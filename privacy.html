<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective date: February 16, 2026</p>

<p>Undrift ("we", "our", or "the app") is a relationship reminder app that helps you stay in touch with the people who matter. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

<h2>Data We Access</h2>
<p>Undrift accesses your device's Contacts to let you choose which people you'd like to be reminded to call. Specifically, the app reads:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact names</li>
    <li>Phone numbers</li>
    <li>Contact identifiers (used internally to match reminders to contacts)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<p>All data stays on your device. Undrift does not have a server, does not collect analytics, and does not transmit any of your personal information off your phone. Your contact data is used solely to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display contact names and phone numbers within the app</li>
    <li>Schedule local notifications reminding you to reach out</li>
    <li>Initiate phone calls or FaceTime calls when you choose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>Your reminder preferences and tracked contacts are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data is not backed up to any external server. If you delete the app, all stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Undrift does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app does not contain ads.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>The app uses local notifications (not push notifications) to remind you to call your contacts. These are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Undrift is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version here with a new effective date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:zach@undrift.app">zach@undrift.app</a>.</p>
